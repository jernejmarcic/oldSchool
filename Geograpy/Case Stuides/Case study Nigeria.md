## Traficking of Nigerian women to Europe  
Many women are trafficked between Nigeria and Western Europe   for the purpose of sexual exploitation. It is one of Europe’s most   persistent trafficking flows, with Nigerian women frequently   accounting for over 10 per cent of the trafficked people in Western   and Central Europe. The women, believing that they are going to a   prosperous new life, sign a contract in Nigeria that is “blessed” in a   ritual (called juju) by a priest. Having been trafficked to Europe, they   are forced into prostitution to pay back a debt, sometimes as much   as €40,000–€70,000. Threats may be made to family members, and   the women are controlled by “madams”, older Nigerian women who   have themselves been victims in the past. UN evidence suggests that   corruption and blackmail are rife, and the prostitution gangs may   also be engaged in the distribution of drugs on Europe’s streets.
