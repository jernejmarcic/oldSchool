# South Korea's demographic dividend
The “Asian Tigers” of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan are good examples of the advantages to be gained from reducing fertility rates. South Korea, for example, made
a rapid transition from high to low fertility between 1960 and 1990, and this transition was a springboard for economic growth. South Korea's success was the result of addressing population issues while also investing in reproductive health programmes, education and economic policies to create infrastructure and manufacturing. Korea followed an aggressive population policy. The government invested in health centres to provide a range of services, including family planning. Field workers visited homes and provided family planning information and methods. The government set a target of 45 per cent of married couples 
using family planning. A contributing factor to reducing fertility was that people saw that having fewer children improved family life. As a result, between 1950 and 1975, fertility dropped from 5.4 children per woman to 2.9. By 2005, fertility had dropped to 1.2 children per woman.

## Shifting the education strategy
The government also focused on education.Between the 1950s and 1960s, South Korea's education strategy shifted to universal schooling, where previously primary education had served only  about 54 per cent of children. A “production-oriented” education would provide  
people with the knowledge and skills they needed to achieve economic development. The  
shift in focus and increased commitment to education contributed to 97 per cent of  
school-age children attending school in 1990.

## Economic planning
At the same time, South Korea's economic plans were comprehensive. In the 1950s, South Korea's economy, based largely on farming and shing, was weak. Improved relations with Japan led to investment capital that strengthened agricultural, fishing and manufacturing  
industries, including shipping. The South Korean government also addressed unemployment  
through a rural construction programme that provided minimum wages for workers  
involved in the construction of infrastructure, including dams and roads. This effort  
contributed to both the development of a national infrastructure and economic  
growth.
