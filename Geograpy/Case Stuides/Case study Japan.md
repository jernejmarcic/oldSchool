# Japan’s ageing population 

Since 1945 the age structure of Japan’s population has greatly changed, largely due to a decrease in both birth and death rates. The population is ageing much more rapidly than  
that of other countries (although a number of European countries, such as Italy and Greece, are not far behind). The number of elderly people living alone in Japan increased from 0.8 million in 1975 to over 2.5 million in 2000. Since 1975 the percentage of young people has gradually declined, and by 2015 they accounted for only 13 per cent of the population. 

At present, 26 per cent of the Japanese population are aged over 65 years. This is creating a huge burden on pension funds and social welfare programmes, especially health care. Problems include:

- inadequate nursing facilities  
-  depletion of the labour force  
-  deterioration of the economy  
- a trade decit  
- migration of Japanese industry to other  countries  
- the high cost of funding pensions and healthcare  
- falling demand for schools and teachers  
- new jobs needed for the elderly  
- new leisure facilities needed for the elderly  
- an increase in the burden on the working population to serve the dependent population  
- reduced demand for goods from the smaller working population 
- a need for in-migration  to fuel any increase in the workforce.
