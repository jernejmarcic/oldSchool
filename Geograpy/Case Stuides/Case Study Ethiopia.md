# Ethiopia and the demographic dividend

Since 2000, Ethiopia has made very good progress in improving the health and development of its people. Infant and maternal mortality are on the decline, under-5 mortality has been cut in half, and literacy has nearly doubled. In addition, women's 
 eproductive health has increased greatly. Among married women, use of modern
contraceptive methods grew from 6percent in 2000 to 27 per cent in 2012. Women are now having on average 4.8 children, compared with 6.5 a decade ago; and in Addis Ababa, the capital, women on average have just over two children.

However, Ethiopia will have to substantially increase investment in meeting family planning needs to create the age structure needed for a demographic dividend. More than 40 per cent of the population is under age 15, and the population pyramid in 2010,  
despite the declines in mortality and fertility, is still dominated by a large base of young people. By 2030 Ethiopia will approach the age structure conditions that can facilitate accelerated economic growth. Thus, Ethiopia remains nearly two decades away from a possible demographic dividend, even with continued progress.
