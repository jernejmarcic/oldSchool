# Literacy and gender equality policies in Kerala

Kerala, a largely agricultural state in south–west India, is the most densely populated area of India but with an even spread of population and no large cities. It has had remarkable success in improving health, literacy and education, and in bringing down the birth rate. Its success is even more remarkable because it has a much lower per capita income than the rest of India. A number of factors help to account for Kerala’s success. These include:

- the autonomy and stability of the government  
-  long-standing and continuing social reform  
-  the status of women in society.

The result is a society that has enabled large sections of the population to give voice to their views and needs.

## The role of women in Kerala
The status of women in Kerala has been extremely important in the region’s development.
