# Literacy and gender equality policies in Kerala

Kerala, a largely agricultural state in south–west India, is the most densely populated area of India but with an even spread of population and no large cities. It has had remarkable success in improving health, literacy and education, and in bringing down the birth rate. Its success is even more remarkable because it has a much lower per capita income than the rest of India. A number of factors help to account for Kerala’s success. These include:

- the autonomy and stability of the government  
-  long-standing and continuing social reform  
-  the status of women in society.

The result is a society that has enabled large sections of the population to give voice to their views and needs.

## The role of women in Kerala
The status of women in Kerala has been extremely important in the region’s development.

 - There is a tradition of female employment, with girls educated to the same standard as boys.
 - There is open access to universities and colleges where women often study to be doctors and nurses.
 - Jobs have been open to women in health and education since the early 20th century.
 - Women have autonomy in their personal life, where there is no tradition of dowries and  
 there are no obstacles to remarriage.

Kerala has the highest female:male sex ratio in India, with 1,084 females to 1,000 males, compared with the national average of 940:1,000. Kerala’s literacy rate increased from 90 per cent in 1991 to 94 per cent in 2011, and female literacy increased from 86 to 92 per cent over the same period. Kerala has a low infant mortality rate of 13 per thousand (‰), compared with the national average of 80‰, and a high life expectancy of 74years for females and 70 years for males. The TFR is low, just 1.9 below the replacement level. However, despite the high literacy levels, women are marginalized in the economic process and have a lack of control over resources. The work participation rate for women is just 18 per cent compared with 53 per cent for men, and women are concentrated in low-paid jobs such as farming, cottage industries, domestic services and informal economies. The three main ways of gaining access to economic resources are through participation in the labour market, acquiring a share of the family property and establishing a business or taking part in the informal economy. Women’s share in the labour market in Kerala is among the lowest in India. The reasons are unclear but could be related to their role in looking after the household, collecting water and fuelwood, and looking after elderly relatives. While 18 per cent of educated men are unemployed, 71 per cent of educated women are and, for those in work, a higher proportion of women have low-paid jobs and are more likely to be in the informal sector. Women account for 71 per cent of primary school teachers but only 36 per cent of university lecturers. A number of self-help groups (SHG) have been set up to empower women from poor households. Groups of women are organized into neighbourhood groups and have weekly meetings to share experiences, have discussions and undertake training. They also have micro-nance systems that all the participants pay into, and receive money from. The women empowerment programmes cover welfare and support services, training, and advice about income generation. Nevertheless, life still remains hard for many women in Kerala. The shing villages on the coast are very overcrowded, and here mortality rates are higher than the state average. Although there is good progress in social development (health and education), women’s role in decision-making is limited. The legal system, for example, is male dominated. Violence and sexual harassment against women is still common, much of it related to their husbands’ alcohol consumption. Overall, given the high educational level of women, their good health, and numerous government programmes, women cannot be considered completely disadvantaged. However, although the Kerala model has resulted in some improvements in conditions for women, there is still much to be done.
