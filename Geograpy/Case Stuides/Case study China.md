# China’s one-child policy
China has operated the world’s most severe and controversial family planning programme with its one-child policy. The policy, imposed in 1979, had a drastic impact: the birth rate fell to 17 per 1,000 from its 1970 rate of 33. The policy is estimated to have reduced population growth in a country of 1.3 billion by as much as 300 million people over its rst 20 years alone, and prevented as many as 400 million births. The Chinese government has predicted that the population will peak at 1.5 billion in 2033. In 2015 the Chinese government changed the policy to allow couples to have two children. Such draconian family planning has resulted in a disparate ratio of 118 male to every 100 female births, above the global norm of between 103 and 107 boys to every 100 girls. This reects the fact that many people in China value female infants less highly than males, and millions of females were aborted or died as a result of neglect, abandonment or even infanticide. The one-child policy was not an all-encompassing rule but was restricted to ethnic Han Chinese living in urban areas, who comprise only about 36 per cent of the population. While the growing middle classes in urban areas do not discriminate against daughters as much, people in the countryside remain traditionally focused on male heirs, and in most provincial rural areas couples.

could have two children if the rst one was a girl. In other provinces, parents could have two children regardless of the sex of the rst child, and in a few areas the rules were even more relaxed. The declining fertility rate, now about 1.6 births per woman, has eased food security fears. However, the downsides of maintaining a one- child quota include a shrinking labour force and an ageing population. By 2050 China will have nearly 450 million people aged over 60 and 100 million over 80; there will be just 1.6 working adults to support every person aged over 60 compared with more than seven in the 1970s. At its peak in the 1960s, the fertility rate was 5.8 babies for each woman of childbearing age and it is now just 1.8, well below the replacement rate of 2.1. The fertility rates in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou are among the lowest in the world.

## 2013 reforms
The prospect of an ageing society in which one worker is left to support two parents and four grandparents has led China to relax the one- child policy. The loosening of the policy, rst announced in November 2013, allows couples to have a second child if either parent is an only child. It is meant to signal the beginning of a more family-friendly bureaucracy. Provinces can set their own timetable for implementing the reform. Party conservatives still fear two things about loosening population controls. The rst is that, without proper controls, the population may grow beyond the country’s planned capacity to feed itself (1.5 billion people by the year 2033). The second is that loosening too quickly may spur a baby boom that would strain public services. But there are reasons to be optimistic that this will not happen. Factors other than the one-child policy, such as a lack of social security support, have also encouraged couples to limit their offspring, so the policy’s relaxation is unlikely to lead to a population boom. Many urbanites, already burdened by rocketing education and housing costs, consider multiple children an exclusive province of the rich.
