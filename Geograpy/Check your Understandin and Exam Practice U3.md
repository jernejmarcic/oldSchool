Older dependency ratio is a term used to describe the number of [[Older dependant]] to the [[Working age population]]

2. **Describe Japans population structure**
Japan has a very high number of {Old}[[Older dependant]] in comparison to their [[Working age population]]. They also struggle with having having a low [[Younger dependant]] ratio.

As seen on the population pyramid above there is very little [[Younger dependant]]. This will cause similar problems to Japan when the [[Working age population]] will reach retirement age and become [[Older dependant]].

Chinese children born after the policy will also have to face the 1-2-4 problem, which means that one child will have to support 2 parents and 4 grandparents.
