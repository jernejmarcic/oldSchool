1. **Explain the term “older dependency ratio”.**
Older dependency ratio is a term used to describe the number of [[Older dependant]] to the [[Working age population]]

2. **Describe Japans population structure**
Japan has a very high number of {Old}[[Older dependant]] in comparison to their [[Working age population]]. They also struggle with having having a low [[Younger dependant]] ratio. In short Japan has too many old people and too little children are being born. This is better explained in [[Case study Japan]].

3. **Distinguish between pro-natalist policies and anti-natalist policies**
A pro-natalist policy is a policy that encourages famalies to have children for example in the [[Case study Russia]].
A anti-natalist policy is a policy that discourages families from having big families and encourages small families. On of the most infamous examples in the One child policy in [[Case study China]].

4. **Briefly describe the impact of China's one child policy.**
China's one child policy has had many negative impacts on the economy and the demographics of China.
Due to the policy the TFR (total fertility rate) rate fell below the 2.1 needed for a sustainable population.
![[ChinaPopulationPyramid.png]]
As seen on the population pyramid above there is very little [[Younger dependant]]. This will cause similar problems to Japan when the [[Working age population]] will reach retirement age and become [[Older dependant]].

Chinese children born after the policy will also have to face the 1-2-4 problem, which means that one child will have to support 2 parents and 4 grandparents.

5. **Outline the successes of Kerala in terms of gender equality.**
Kerala is one of the 28 states of India.
It is the by far most progressive states in India (read [[Case study Kerala]]). The biggest success of Kerala are:
 - There is a tradition of female employment, with girls educated to the same standard as boys.
 - There is open access to universities and colleges where women often study to be doctors and nurses.
 - Jobs have been open to women in health and education since the early 20th century.
 - Women have autonomy in their personal life, where there is no tradition of dowries and  
 there are no obstacles to remarriage.

6. **Suggest ways in which gender equality in Kerala can be improved.**
Female literacy rate (92%) is still lower than male literacy rate (94%), women are marginalised in the economic processes (working population women {18%}, working population males {53%}), women are concentrated in low paying jobs.

7. **Outline the main methods of tracking trafficking of people**
The USA’s Trafficking and Violence  
Protection Act (TVPA 2000) encourages governments to join in the fight  
against human trafficking.  
The TVPA contains three main components:  
 - Protection – increased efforts to protect foreign national victims as well as non-immigrants.  
 - Prosecution – of traffickers related to forced labour and sexual exploitation.  
 - Prevention – to assist other governments to reduce trafficking

Other attempts include:
 - Raising public awareness
 - Passing policies that will prevent trafficking
 - Governments having up-to-date registrations of births and migrations in the area
 - Allowing trade Unions

8. **Evaluate the methods to combat the trafficking of people**
Just one of these methods will do little in preventing human trafficking, however many laws and policies together can do a lot in preventing. The most effective way to prevent human trafficking would be to fix the root problems in the source countries.
For example:
 - *Raising public awernes*, helps by people being more aware of the problem, and noticing the signs of it actually happening
 - *Governments having up-to-date registrations of births and migrations in the area*, helps, since the governments will be able to know who enters the country, and since "unregistered" people are at the highest risk of abuse.

9. **Define the term "Demographic Dividend"**
The demographic dividend refers to a bulge in the number of adults in a population. It occurs when fertility rates decline, allowing faster economic growth. The decline in fertility often follows a decline in infant and child mortality rates, as well as increased life expectancy. As families recognize that fewer of their children will die during infancy or childhood, they begin to have fewer children. However, this drop in fertility rates is not immediate. The lag between falling death rates and falling fertility produces a bulge in the population that surges through age groups (cohorts). For a period of time, this “bulge” increases the dependency ratio. Eventually, this cohort begins to enter the workforce. As fertility rates continue to fall and the elderly population still have relatively short life expectancies, the dependency ratio drops dramatically. With fewer younger dependents and fewer older dependents, the largest segment of the population is people of productive working age. Thus the dependency ratio declines dramatically, leading to the demographic dividend.

10. **Outline the advantages of the Demographic dividend**
The demographic dividend can deliver a number of benefits. The first is the increased labour supply. However, this depends on the ability of the economy to absorb and productively employ the extra workers. The second is the increase in savings. As the number of dependents decreases, individuals can save more. Thirdly, decreases in fertility rates result in healthier women and fewer social and economic pressures at home. This also allows parents to invest more resources per child, leading to better health and educational outcomes. Finally, the increasing domestic demand brought about by the increasing GDP per capita and the decreasing dependency ratio leads to economic growth.


# Exam practice

(a) 
	(i) **Define the term "dependency ratio"**
		The dependency ratio is the ratio of [[Younger dependant]] and [[Older dependant]] divided by the [[Working age population]].
	(ii) **Compare the dependency ratio of asylum seekers with that of the general population**
		While the ratios on the graph vary wildly, with the exception of Sweden Asylum seekers generally have a lower dependency ratio than the working population.
	(iii) **Suggest reasons for the differences you have outlined**
		It may be due to the fact that old and young people would not be able to make the journey without assistance from younger people, also [[Older dependant]] are less likely to travel as they do not need jobs or just stay home and rely on the [[Remittances]] that are sent by younger generations.

(b)
	(i) **Outline the meaning of the term "family planning"**
