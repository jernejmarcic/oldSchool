## Geography of Iceland

### Physical:

Iceland is located on the Mid-Atlanitc Ridge.
Iceland is located between the Greenland sea, and the North Atlantic ocean
NW of UK
Iceland is approx. 5 times bigger than Slovenia
The land is mostly a pleateu with mountain peaks, and a coastline with [[Fjords]].
11% of the country is covered by glaciers and is surrounded by water.
If current global warming trends continue the rising water levels and melting ice 
Iceland s a vlocanic island with savere volcanic activity
in 2010 the eyjafjallajokull volcano erupted 1666 meters high and distrubed air traffic for 
weeks.
The geology of Iceland dates back to the [[Mesozoic era]].

*Since Iceland is a volcanic country, its waters smell of ==sulfur dioxide==. Even though the gas is toxic, the water is still safe (do not drink)*

## How Climate change is affecting the Geography of Iceland
Iceland's glaciers are melting.
All of Iceland's glaciers are expected to melt in 200 years if the current trends continue.

### Not Ok!
This has already happened to the [Okjökull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okj%C3%B6kull) glacier, which was declared dead in 2014 by Oddur Sigurðsson (this means that it was too small to move), this Glacier then full melted in 2019.
Where the glacier once stood a commemorative plaque read:
	
	A letter to the future  
  
	Ok is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its status as a glacier.  
	In the next 200 years all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path.  
	This monument is to acknowledge that we know  
	what is happening and what needs to be done.  
	Only you know if we did it.

### Sólheimajökull

## How Climate change is affecting the Economy of Iceland

Climate change has actually had a positive effect on the economy of Iceland

### THE FINNAFJORD PROJECT
The **Finnafjord Port** ([Icelandic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_language "Icelandic language"): _**Finnafjörður**_ [[ˈfɪnnaˌfjœrðʏr̥]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Icelandic "Help:IPA/Icelandic")) is a proposed deepwater port and industrial site in [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland "Iceland").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnafjord_Port#cite_note-:1-1) Construction is expected to begin between 2021 and 2023 and will continue until at least 2040.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnafjord_Port#cite_note-:0-2)

The project is a new landmark deep sea port in the North Atlantic ocean for   transshipment crossing the North Pole capturing the Asia-Europe route. The   location is in Finnafjord (Icelandic: Finnafjörður) in North-East Iceland.   The unique offshore situation in the Finnafjord is well known by ship   operators in the area since hundreds of years back. Recently this was verified   by the Icelandic Maritime Administration. The unique onshore situation was   first discovered a few years ago. Since year 2004 an industrial site of 167 ha   has been demarcated and outlined in the masterplan for the area.   The open discussion about trans-arctic shipment during the last years   has truly marked Iceland as an ideal location for a new deep sea port   (transshipment Hub) in the North Atlantic ocean. The Finnafjord harbour is   most likely the best location for such a harbour in Iceland.   In the new masterplan for the municipality Langanesbyggd the Finnafjord   area is marked as a harbour with 6,3 km long quays, partly with depths of   50 m. The Finnafjord harbour is to be a commercial harbour. The project is   planned to be a private development with full support of local authorities.

### The northern sea route

Due to the melting of the Ice in the arctic the Northern and Northwest (Since I am talking about Iceland we are focusing on the Northwest) passage allows for much shorter and efficient travel times. Before now ships travelling there would need icebreakers
