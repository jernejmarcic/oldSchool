![[IMG-1 Boy Sleeping next to computer.png]]
The image shows a boy who look to be still in school falling asleep in front of his laptop which is shining brightly (lightmode user) infront of hist face. He is also laying in his clothes and in an strange position. The surroundings are also very dark exepct for ,what is most likely, a power indicator button behind his bed.

What the boy is doing is very unhealthy as the bright light of the laptop contrasted to the dark suroundings is damaging to the eyes, and his sleep schedule. The bright ligh infront of his eyes will also damage his sleep quality. The position he is laying inis also very uncomfortable and unhealthy and when he wakes up he will most likely have pain in his neck and other parts of his body, he will also wake up unrested and will be most likely tired and grumpy throught the day.

**POSITIVE EXPERIENCES WITH SPORT**

  

When I was exercising and doing sport I felt many immediate benefits, although I was tired, after finishing I felt happier and more accomplished, sport also brought benefits to my health as it improved my spinal muscles which helped me with dealing with my scoliosis. It also made me much more flexible and strong increasing my endurance for more physical tasks such as hikes and carrying heavy stuff. Sadly after last year’s end of the year exam period I had to stop with sport to focus more and school and I have sadly not restarted since.

While this is only mine experience I am sure you will experience the benefits as well.

Dear Mom,

I have departed up the mountains, following a lone bird flying high in the air. At the top of the mountain I met a lovely old couple living a an expertly constructed wood hut. There they made me an offer, stay with them and train, or return back down the mountain.

I stayed, not thinking twice about my decision, I could not bare to return to the villager which was controlled by the baron. I swore to myself that I would train, to one day return and finally defeated the tyrannical baron.

The couple has taught me how to use the skills of the animals, there I learned to stay still enough for squires to climb over me and gained the trust of deer, enough to run beside them.

They have taught me how to leap 6 meters into the air, allowing me to leap over the cottage.

Now I think I am ready to retrurn,

to defeat the Baron

The video lists the moon landing and the car (and other successful industries) as some of the reasons.

Americans have an exaggerated view of their country, mostly because of the propaganda that they are the greatest, free-est, richest and most advanced country in the world.

I think the videos argument is in some aspects for and in some aspects against the belief of American superiority. They list many respectful traveling examples, while they also tell us about those who truly do believe they are the greatest.

They in a way do apply, but since Slovenia is a lot smaller and more connected to its neighbors its less obvious. Like in the USA younger people tend to be a lot more progressive than older generations.

  

In many ascepsts belonging to a “right” nation is very important, if simply for the strength of the passport. It also affects what opportunities you may have at the start of your life, what kind of education you can receive.

  

Generally Patriotism is a more positive trait than Nationalist, but now many nationalists call themselves “true patriots”. Although having a balanced an analytical view of your country is the best to have a “healthy” and factual overview of the world.

Living in other countries has a predomiantely positive effect. People who travel a lot are enerally a lot more tolreant and respectfull.

  

"When we moved from our farm in the country it took a little time to adjust. The kids of course were extremely happy with the move. The City provided many opportuities

for adventure. During the day the kids were busy exploring the surronding area, the local parks.They spent countless afternoons playing with all their new neighbours.

They had fun trying out all the different ice-cream places and sweet shops together with the various spoils of a city.

Us adults however had a harder time adjusting. Farm life is **vasly** different than city life. In many ways it was better. We were closer to many services than ever before,

instead of having to drive to the local market for the things our farm didn't produce we were only a bike-ride away, instead of having to wake up at 5 we were able to sleep in

till 7. The children also didn't need spend an hour getting to the local school, and the quality of the teaching is a lot better. In the city we also got better jobs allowing

us to enyoying the many dinning options the city offered, however the food never quite tasted like the fresh farm-grown food we used to eat.However there were also negatives,

the constant drone of traffic kept us up during the night, we started to worry about the safety of our children playing outside with all the traffic, the city also reeked from

pollution of all the cars, and all the city lights blocked our wiev of the stars.

But for all the negatives we ezperienced from our move we quickly adjucted, and from some minor pet-peeves such as the traffic we think our decision to move to the city

was great for our family.

Our children were able to use this opportunity to pursue higher education and my olderst son is now attendign college and my daughter is already starting her first job in

a big company. Living in the country would have never provided our family with such amazing opportunities. Me and my wife were also able"
