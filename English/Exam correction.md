	Jack often thinks how different his life would become if he were more adventurous. He's a rather cautious man who takes risks only provided that they do not unsettle his cozy, well-organized life. Yet he sometimes feels that if he made braver decisions, his life would change for the better, although deep down he knows that there's not much likelihood of that happening. For example, three years ago, they offered him a job in Africa. If he had accepted the offer, he would have had to live in Africa for two years, he would have enjoyed an enormous increase in his salary as well. But jack is not the type of person who will give up the security of his home unless he feels even more secure in his new circumstances.
