## Move from the rural area
Audience: General public
**How has the move affested the family?**
"When we moved from our farm in the country it took a little time to adjust. The kids of course were extremely happy with the move. The City provided many opportuities
for adventure. During the day the kids were busy exploring the surronding area, the local parks.They spent countless afternoons playing with all their new neighbours.
They had fun trying out all the different ice-cream places and sweet shops together with the various spoils of a city.
Us adults however had a harder time adjusting. Farm life is **vasly** different than city life. In many ways it was better. We were closer to many services than ever before,
instead of having to drive to the local market for the things our farm didn't produce we were only a bike-ride away, instead of having to wake up at 5 we were able to sleep in
till 7. The children also didn't need spend an hour getting to the local school, and the quality of the teaching is a lot better. In the city we also got better jobs allowing
us to enyoying the many dinning options the city offered, however the food never quite tasted like the fresh farm-grown food we used to eat.However there were also negatives,
the constant drone of traffic kept us up during the night, we started to worry about the safety of our children playing outside with all the traffic, the city also reeked from
pollution of all the cars, and all the city lights blocked our wiev of the stars.
But for all the negatives we ezperienced from our move we quickly adjucted, and from some minor pet-peeves such as the traffic we think our decision to move to the city
was great for our family.
Our children were able to use this opportunity to pursue higher education and my olderst son is now attendign college and my daughter is already starting her first job in"
