## Boston Dynamics

 - Boston Dynamics originaly started developing its robot for military, however they have changed their stance on developing robots for military.
	
- However this does not prevent for private parties from purshasing ther robots most notably the SPOT robot, and ataching weapons to it (which has been done), or reverse engineereing it and building another one (also been done)
	
- A art company called MSCHF attached a painball gun to a Spot robot and let users controll it, to destroy an art gallery, 
	
- A youtube attachad a fully automatic gun to a robot dog similar design and used it for target practice.

- An unknown individual from Russia has attached an AK47 to the same model of robot dog
	 
- The robots have luckuly not yet been used for military purpouses yet, but if a *normal* person can make something like that, a military power can do something much worse
