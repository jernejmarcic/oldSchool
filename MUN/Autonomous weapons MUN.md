### A.I. and autonomous weapons
Dear esteemed delegates and honorable chair,

We are the delegation of Iceland, and we recognize the danger posed by artificial intelligence if used by the military.
The IIIM which stands for the Icelandic Institute for Intelligent Machines has publicly shunned the development of A.I. 
WE believe that the development of A.I. for military purposes is one of the largest threats to global peace and stability. 




## Boston Dynamics and Unitree robotics

 - Boston Dynamics originally started developing its robot for military, however, they have changed their stance on developing robots for military.
 
 - A Chinese company, Unitree is also producing commercial robots that have the capability to be used for military purposes	
 
- However, this does not prevent for private parties from purchasing these robots most notably the SPOT (from Boston Dynamics) robot (which costs 75 thousand), and attaching weapons to it (which has been done), or reverse engineering it and building another one, or buying models from Unitree (which cost as low as 2.7 thousand)
	
- An art collective called MSCHF attached a paintball gun to a Spot robot and let users control it, to destroy an art gallery, 
	
- A youtuber attached a fully automatic gun to a robot dog of similar design, created by a company called Unitree.

- An unknown individual from Russia has attached an AK47 to the same model of robot dog
	 
- The robots have luckily not yet been used for military purposes yet, but if a *normal* person can make something like that, a military power can do something much worse

## Use of autonomous weapons
Iceland disagrees with any kind of autonomous weapons, and we believe that is on of the biggest risks to peace and prosperity
