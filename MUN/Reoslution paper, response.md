Dear Honorable chair and esteemed delegates,

The delegation of Iceland agrees and is already working on many of the points proposed by the resolution.
HOWEVER, we strongly disagree with point **5** and point **7**, while Iceland supports NATO and all NATO decisions, we will echo the words of then Prime Minister of Iceland, during the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington D.C.:
	
##### "My people are unarmed and have been unarmed since the days of our Viking forefathers. We neither have nor can have an armyâ€¦ But our country is, under certain circumstances, of vital importance for the safety of the North Atlantic area."

"Iceland would like to extend their thanks to the delegates of other countries for changing point **5** on the resolution paper, where we do not feel and obligation to militarize. We look forward to our cooperation in the future"
