## The security situation in the Baltic and Nordic states
Dear esteemed delegates and honorable chair,

We are the delegation of Iceland, recognize the threats and the current security situation in the Nordic and Baltic states.
The current situation in those places is due to the increased hostilities, mostly caused by Russia and its allies. The delegation of Iceland stands behind and supports all the decisions proposed by our NATO allies, so long they follow our Security Policy. (Iceland will have no military of its owns and will reamin pacifist, as it has for the past milleniium, since the age of the vikings).
We will however offer suport as a Strategic postion if there was any conflict to arrise. 


## A.I. and autonomous weapons
Dear esteemed delegates and honorable chair,

We are the delegation of Iceland, and we recognize the danger posed by artificial intelligence if used by the military.
The IIIM which stands for the Icelandic institute for Intelligent Machines has publicly shunned the development of A.I. 
WE believe that the development of A.I. for mlitary purpouses is on of the largest therets to global peace and stability.
