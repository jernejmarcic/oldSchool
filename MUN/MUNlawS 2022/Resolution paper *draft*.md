    Reminding, all nations that the stance of Iceland is firmly against any and all kinds of A.I research aimed towards the military. We very firmly believe that military A.I is one of the biggest threats to human prosperity, and global peace.

We therefore:


Implore all NATO members to impose the strictest bans on A.I research aimed towards the use by the military.


Request all NATO members  to clearly state what state founded A.I labs are working towards.

Urges all A.I. labs to not accept any military funding
