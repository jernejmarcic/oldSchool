## The security situation in the baltic and nordic states

### Short History
Iceland is one of the founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), it joined in 1941, to heavy oppsoition by the public. Iceland is a special NATO ally, since it has no military, and it is allowed to stay that way because of its strategic position. For defense it relies on other NATO members.
The foreign minister of Iceland (Bjarni Benediktsson) famously saidduring the signing og NATO in whashington, D.C, on the 4th of April in 1949:
	
	"My people are unarmed and have been unarmed since the days of our Viking forefathers. We neither have nor can have an army… But our country is, under certain circumstances, of vital importance for the safety of the North Atlantic area."

### The security situation in the baltic and nordic states
Iceland, along with its all NATO allies and manny other cuntres has fully condemed Russia for invading Ukraine and it aligns itself fully with the sanctions imposed on Russia. 
Iceland is redy to carry outs it commints to NATO, as long as they are in accoridance to its National Security Policy.
Due to Russias unprovoked attack on Ukraine Iceland has stopped attenting the Arctic Counclil, which is Cahired by Russia, Russia has also been kicked out of several councils, including the: Council of Europe, the UN Human Rights Council, the Council of the Baltic Sea States, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council and the Northern Dimension.

#### Humanitarian assistance
Iceland has also sent Humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, from writting this its humantarian aid ammounted to 1 billion ISK (Local currency {Icelandic Krona}), or 7.2 million EUR. The focus of Iceland’s humanitarian assistance has been on collaboration with key priority partners such as the UN and ICRC with a strong focus on providing flexible funding, allowing partners to prioritize where needed during the crisis response. 

Iceland also helps refugees who want to come to the country, it offers an information page in both English and Ukranian.
	On their webiste its written:
		
		"Ukrainian citizens and their family members are entitled to collective protection in Iceland."

The government of Iceland has chosen to welcome 140 especially vulnurable refugees and welcome an additional 100 from Moldova (To which over 150 000 people fled), this number seems low, but with the combined population of 341,243 the refugees will account for 0.07% of the total population of Iceland.
