## Moderated Couscous

## Humanitarian assistance
Iceland has also sent Humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, from writing this its humanitarian aid amounted to 1 billion ISK (Local currency {Icelandic Króna}), or 7.2 million EUR. The focus of Iceland’s humanitarian assistance has been on collaboration with key priority partners such as the UN and ICRC with a strong focus on providing flexible funding, allowing partners to prioritize where needed during the crisis response. 

Iceland also helps refugees who want to come to the country, it offers an information page in both English and Ukrainian.
	On their website, it's written:
		
		"Ukrainian citizens and their family members are entitled to collective protection in Iceland."

The government of Iceland has chosen to welcome 140 especially vulnerable refugees and welcome an additional 100 from Moldova (To which over 150 000 people fled), this number seems low, but with the combined population of 341,243 the refugees will account for 0.07% of the total population of Iceland.

## Resolution paper

### Response
Dear Honorable chair and esteemed delegates,

The delegation of Iceland agrees and is already working on many of the points proposed by the resolution.
HOWEVER, we strongly disagree with point **5** and point **7**, while Iceland supports NATO and all NATO decisions, we will echo the words of then Prime Minister of Iceland, during the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington D.C.:
	
	"My people are unarmed and have been unarmed since the days of our Viking forefathers. We neither have nor can have an army… But our country is, under certain circumstances, of vital importance for the safety of the North Atlantic area."


"Iceland would like to extend their gratitude to the delegates of other countries for changing point **5** on the resolution paper, and freeing us from the obligation to militarize. We look forward to our cooperation in the future, thank you esteemed delegates"

### The response to Hungarian opposition
Iceland voices its support for the current state of the resolution paper, however we acknowledge the plight of other countries, when it comes to Russian energy, therefore we propose a plan to make all NATO states as independent of Russian imports as possible. 
 ~~Hungary getting sacked lol~~

### USA's amendment response
		
	"We disagree with USAs proposal since the sentence serves to remind us of the consiqence and it is there to prevent us from distancing us from the porblem"
