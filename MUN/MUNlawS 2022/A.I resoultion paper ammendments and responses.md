1.) Iceland sees any Artificial Intelligence intent to cause any kind of bodily or emotional harm as harmful.

2.) As stated before, Iceland is non-militaristic and pacifist, no military manufacturing will be conducted.

~~In democratic countries, the demands and concerns of its citizens should be heard.~~

4.) Iceland will not in any way, shape or form support the development of autonomous weapons and will not allow ANY kinds of tests to be conducted on its soil. We propose an amendment that will exclude any country which has no military.

6.) Iceland believes that 7 need further elaboration and discussion, simply static that LETHAL autonomous weapons need to be used for "public order and safety of civilians", which is a very wide term, and needs further elaboration and discussion. We also believe that the use of LETHAL autonomous weapons is overkill and that non-lethal options should always be preferred. 


"We see we do not have the support for our amendments to pass, therefore we will allow the resolution paper to pass, with the understanding that no member country will recive any support in the development of autonomous wepaons"
