# PEGASUS, a threat to Democracy
![[PEGASUS.jpg | 550]]
Pegasus is apyware developed by the [NSO group](https://www.nsogroup.com/), a private company that creates spyware and other software 
> That helps government agencies prevent and investigate terrorism and crime to save thousands of lives around the globe.

[[The New Spy Wars]]
[[Pegasus, NSO Groupâ€™s Insidious Spyware]]

The software can infect Andoid and iOS phones through a 0-Day exploit and can see ALL the data on the phone (picture, messages, files, etc)

**Mention Anom phones
Mention the Panopticon**

## Arguments
### For the use
"Do you have anything to hide?"

	"If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear"
	"We need to use PEGASUS to fight threts against national security, since all other countryes have acces to it and use it.
	Its a invaluable tool to catch terrorists or other leaders of organized crime.
	Not used for mass survilance, PEGASUS is targeted survaillance"

	"Guily untill proven innocent protects us by keeping potentally harmfull people away from the public untill they are proven to not be dangerous
		For example, a person convicted of murder, will remain incarcaret untill it is proven that they have not and will not kill.
		A few days of discomfort is a small price to pay for safety"

	"Just to pretect from bad leaders should not be a resoin to ban a tool such as PEGASUS. The miss use of PEGASUS should be dealt with differently than outright bannin it.
	The danger of missuse is outwieght by the potential of the tool to help the national security, and keep our citiezens safe from terrorists"
	
	"An example of succesful use of targeted spyware can be the Anom phones (honeypot/sting operation from 2018-2021), a phones that appealed to indiciduals concerned about their privacy, which are mostly criminals. This tool allowed us to topple many organized crime rings"

	"As a response to the second speaker, those innocent and hiding from harmfull goverment regiemes can employ the same tactics to stay safe"

	"Peace can be upheld by trasnperancy, helps by working on compromises and resolutions"

**Alternatves**:
 - Privacy of innocent EU citizens --> important
 - Prosoing regulation (usage of spyware by gov.)
 - Goverment should take controll of NSO?
 - This legislation -> proposes by the sommision in the form of directly supportedby: EU parlament and EU court


 - National security
 - Everyone else has it
 - Catching terrorists
 - Catalonia 

**Responses:**
Revelaing our processes will be a threat to National Security, revealing our ways would allow terrorists to be better at avoiding
	**"Securrity by obscurity"**

Private parties controlling powerfull spyware are too dangerous

### Against the use
 - A threat to democracy
 - Imrpoved trust:
	 - EU countries trust eachother more
	 - Better relations
	 - Better cooperation
	 - United front
	 - Better geopolitical situation 

	"The use of the PEGASUS spyware and other forms of spyware erdoes the valuable trust between the members of the European Union."
	"If countries cannot coopearte between eachother it erodes, the peace and the security and wellbeing of its citizens"

#### Negation:
Stance: Pegasus is a terror fighting tool, very effective. NSO group Isreali, good actor, only del with cheked governments, truned down 300 deals on ethical grounds. if you ban pegasus in EU, EU is in disadvantage

Inefective at security because government uses it for its own gain!

Stay in power.

How would you prevent missuse? How can they judge who is a "good country"? Whle pegasus is trully a tool that CAN fight crime, how would you see preventing ts missuse by governmentsto spy on revolutionaries, protestors, or journalists

How do you know that NSO is a good actor? What is their guidline for etchical uses for PEGASUS, how will THEY prevent missuse by their clients. Where does the 300 figure come from? Reccomend more transperency, to government and public. 

There is no proof that privacy cannot exist with privacy.


- Threat do democracy/danger of miss use:
	- Danger of miss use:
		- Dictators can use it for spying on citizens or revolutionaries
		- Spying on jounalists
		- Spying on Activists
		- Spying on protestors/organizers


Security of citizens is core value of EU.
What is ore important privacy or security.

We are not sayin pegasus is innefective, we are saying that pegasus' capacity for missuse outweighs its benifit
